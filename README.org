*UPDATE 2017-01-24*: Now use =avy= instead of =ace-jump-mode=.

Jump to and correct spelling errors using =avy= and flyspell. Inspired by
[[https://github.com/abo-abo/][abo-abo(Oleh Krehel)]]'s [[https://github.com/abo-abo/ace-link][ace-link]].

* Setup
  : (add-to-list 'load-path "")
  : (require 'ace-flyspell)

  Optional:
  : M-x ace-flyspell-setup

  If you call =M-x ace-flyspell-setup= , then this setup binds the command
  =ace-flyspell-dwim= to @@html:<kbd>@@C-.@@html:</kbd>@@, which is originally bound to
  =flyspell-auto-correct-word= if you enable the =flyspell-mode=. Of course, you
  can choose to change the key binding.

  Usually, you should enable =flyspell-mode= because this package aims to jump
  to and correct spelling errors detected by =flyspell=, or at least you need to
  run =flyspell-buffer= to detect spelling errors.

* Usage
  There are three available commands:
** =ace-flyspell-jump-word=
   This command jumps to an spelling error using =avy=, and move the point to
   where the spelling error is.

   The following demo shows the usage of =ace-flyspell-jump-word=:
   [[./screencasts/ace-flyspell-jump-word.gif]]

   If you prefer this command to the following =ace-flyspell-dwim= (which will
   be bound to @@html:<kbd>@@C-.@@html:</kbd>@@ if you call =M-x ace-flyspell-setup=), you should probably
   give it a key binding.
** =ace-flyspell-correct-word=
   This command is different from =ace-flyspell-jump-word= in the sense that it
   aims to *correct* rather than *jump to* the spelling error. At first, it
   looks like =ace-flyspell-jump-word=, but after you jump to the misspelt word,
   it will enter another /mode/, where you hit @@html:<kbd>@@.@@html:</kbd>@@ to invoke
   =flyspell-auto-correct-word= to correct the current misspelt word and hit any
   other key to accept the correction and return to the original position. You
   can also hit @@html:<kbd>@@,@@html:</kbd>@@ to save the current word into personal dictionary.

   This command is useful when you're writing an article and want to temporarily
   go back to some spelling error and return to where you left off after fixing
   the error.
** =ace-flyspell-dwim=
   If the word under the cursor is misspelt, then this command is identical to
   =flyspell-auto-correct-word=, otherwise it will call
   =ace-flyspell-correct-word= to jump to and correct some spelling error.

   This command is bound to @@html:<kbd>@@C-.@@html:</kbd>@@ after you call =M-x ace-flyspell-setup=.

   The following demo shows the usage of =ace-flyspell-dwim= (Since there is no
   misspelt word at the cursor, =ace-flyspell-dwim= actually performs the same
   thing as =ace-flyspell-correct-word= does):
